- 👋 Hi, I’m Yuyang (Alex) Tang, an MSc in Applied Computing student @UofT. I got my Bachelor's degree at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University.
- 👀 I am an amateur photographer, committed to taking interesting and inspiring pictures. I’m interested in computer vision and machine learning. In spring 2022, I studied at the National University of Singapore as an exchange student, where I worked as an undergraduate research intern in Single-Domain Generalization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about computer vision and natural language processing.  My ongoing courses include Computational Imaging, Computational Linguistics, Computer Imaging and 3D Sensing, Natural Language Computing, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking for internship opportunities after May, 2024 and eager to collaborate with passionate peers in computer vision or other AI fields 😄!
- 📫 My email is yytang@cs.toronto.edu. You are always welcome if you have any questions about my work or me!
