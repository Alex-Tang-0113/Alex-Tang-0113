👋 Hi, I’m Yuyang (Alex) Tang, an MSc in Applied Computing student @UofT. I got my Bachelor's degree at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University.
👀 I’m interested in computer vision and machine learning, and always looking for opportunities to unleash my passion and dive deeper in these fields.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about computer vision and natural language processing. My ongoing courses include Computational Imaging, Computational Linguistics, Computer Imaging and 3D Sensing, Natural Language Computing, etc.
💞️ I’m looking for internship opportunities after May, 2024 and eager to collaborate with passionate peers in computer vision, machine learning or other inspiring fields 😄!
